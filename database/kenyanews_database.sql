the country','2003-04-25 00:00:00','VICTOR BWIRE','It seems we are back to high-level radicalisation of the youth in the country as we scale up the politics of the country.\n\nWhile at it, our leaders, including senior public officers and politicians, are by default playing a role in the escalation of tensions in the country by participating and sounding warnings that the country might be drifting towards the brink of the precipice.\n\nOther than the President, some leaders ought to slow down in public engagements with citizens on governance issues and altercations amongst themselves on simple matters.\n\nFor any developments to happen, duty bearers must thicken their skins, listen more and talk less- that’s the sacrifices that come with working in and for the public service.\n\nGovernment communication must be reshaped and be made very relevant, for most of the public engagements of our leaders, even when on development tours across the country, seem stuck on political communication, which leave citizens not sure why the visits.\n\nThose in charge of these visits and related messaging ought to be a bit thorough in their preparations and do due diligence on the projects.\n\nOutside of the fact that some of the discussions center on matters of development and budget allocations, it’s also seen as a lack of preparedness when leaders from sections where the development tours and public engagements visit the state house on claims that they are seeking development.\n\nThis charade seems to ignite agitation among the public and creates the feeling of deception that seems to be gripping the country.\n\nStreamlining government communications, which required training of cabinet and principal secretaries, public communication officers, the purchase of critical infrastructure, and a working formula for formally engaging with citizens and the media, has been delayed.\n\nHowever, I am sure lessons have been learned, and attention is being given to structured and targeted engagement with both traditional and new media.\n\nWhy would Governors not seek and push for money to the counties through improved allocations and disbursements through the CoG, and individually be seeking resources from state House, or MPs, seeking resources through the Parliamentary budget making processes, but opt to seek such from State house?\n\nThe politics of extremism and direct confrontation that is building up across the country as we see leaders, both religious and political, throwing jabs at each other while Kenyans, as they gradually become emotionally charged, are cheering on is worrying.\n\nWhile the ongoing political processes are healthy and within the human rights of people in democracy, caution is necessary especially looking at the history of our country ascendancy to the presidency is a matter of life to death to voters. The politics of its either me or you look dangerous for the country.\n\nWe might just need to disengage from these mass high-charged political engagements and stop the temptations of pushing Kenyans from the various political and generational divides, cheering on without caring about the outcome of the polarization.\n\nThe cheering crowds are growing in numbers and blindly following their political masters at the risk of pushing the country to the edges.\n\nThe online warriors are growing, and the political speeches become emotive and insulting, creating an environment less conducive for development and constructive national debates.\n\nAs we work on emerging the cheering of the political feuds in the country and creating a stage for violent extremism on the political front, other people, including public officers and civil servants, the private sector, religious leaders and professional,s are being drawn into the cast.\n\nHow will critical national issues such as enactment of the electoral laws that remained incomplete including the campaign financing, now the boundaries demarcation and related happen in such a polarized environment?\n\nWhile the absence of physical violence in Kenya thus far is great, I am not sure the ongoing hate and angry exchanges online by Kenyans- at each other and amongst each other- over sometimes very mundane and sometimes serious national issues deserve mention and attention.\n\nWe need to de escalate tensions in the country, and embrace dialogue, even if not on the division of resources.\n\nLet’s streamline communication and messaging by those in authority, give citizens the information they need and not necessarily what they want to hear.','News','2025-04-05 07:01:47','2025-04-05 07:01:47',NULL),(46,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/leader/2025-04-01-editorial-cs-duale-must-reform-social-health-authority','EDITORIAL: CS Duale must reform Social Health Authority','2001-04-25 00:00:00','STAR EDITOR','The team will verify all NHIF pending claims incurred between July 1, 2022, and Sep 30, 2024.\n\n\"Those with personal interests have no space at Afya House.\"','News','2025-04-05 07:01:57','2025-04-05 07:01:57',NULL),(47,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/2025-04-03-lidubwi-nairobis-air-quality-report-calls-for-urgent-action','JACKLINE LIDUBWI: Nairobi’s air quality report calls for urgent action','2003-04-25 00:00:00','JACKLINE LIDUBWI','At the heart of this initiative is the collaboration with Airqo, which focuses on air quality monitoring','News','2025-04-05 07:02:05','2025-04-05 07:02:05',NULL),(48,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/2025-04-03-nzau-musau-when-in-power-dont-be-a-kaaria-butcher-of-wagalla','NZAU MUSAU: When in power, don\'t be a Kaaria, butcher of Wagalla','2003-04-25 00:00:00','NZAU MUSAU','Men like him never get to know the full implications of their wild, thoughtless and ruthless executive actions, until it is too late.\n\nWhen he landed in Garissa in April 1980 donning a wide-brimmed hat of a freshly minted Provincial Commissioner, Benson Naaman Kaaria was breathing fire.\n\nHe wasted little time in announcing to the locals that if they felt fed up with Kenya as a country, they should simply pack their bags and go back to Somalia.\n\nGo back?

In turn, all the locals were rounded up and herded like goats into an enclosure, and interrogated for days.\n\nYour guess is as good as mine as to how polite the interrogation was, complete with the benefit of Miranda rights.\n\nThere were reports of widespread rape of local women as security men descended on their manyattas, and took away their men.\n\nTo rub it in, they torched the manyattas as they left, rendering the women and children who were left behind homeless.\n\nThe second incident was the Wagalla massacre of 1984, also sanctioned by Kaaria. A bandit attack on Ajuran clan members led to the rounding up of all Degodia clan men, and torture at the Wagalla Airstrip.\n\nFor four days, the men were held captive under the scorching sun. They were beaten, starved and tortured.\n\nDuring a visit to Wagalla more than 15 years ago, I met men who still bear the scars of having their weak frames pressed against the runway murram by heavy boots.\n\nTears flowed freely as they revisited the horror they went through. Just like Garissa before, their manyattas were torched, and their women raped.\n\nIn one striking case, a disabled person was burned inside the manyatta. At the airstrip, when they could not take the torture any more, they attempted to break out. They were mercilessly mowed down and their bodies dumped – yes, dumped – in the wilderness.\n\nIt is said that as many as 2,500 people may have died in that carnage. When he visited the massacre site, Kaaria never bothered to see the bodies of the dead or to visit the injured who were being treated in hospitals in Wajir town. Instead, he recommended tougher treatment for the grieving community.\n\nWhen the news reached Nairobi, Kaaria was swiftly kicked out of the province, demoted to work for a government corporation, and eventually faded away from public service.\n\nFast forward to 2011, and Kaaria is given a platform to make amends at the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission. In the full glare of the weeping widows of Wagalla, he refused to budge, saying he had nothing to apologise for, expressing satisfaction with the operation.\n\nInstead, he demanded their sympathy, saying he worked for the people of North Eastern, and they should be grateful to him.\n\nHe also told the commission that he was enjoying his retirement. Men like Kaaria never get to know the full implications of their wild, thoughtless and ruthless executive actions, until it is too late.\n\nThe impact often transcends their life, and silent curses follow them to the grave. Kaaria died two weeks ago and will be buried tomorrow.\n\nHis family is celebrating him as “a pillar of strength and wisdom who touched many lives with his kindness”.\n\nHowever, in Wagalla, it is good riddance for the butcher who altered the course of their lives.

Chiefs earn between Sh30,000 and Sh70,000, depending on experience, location and responsibilities.\n\nCounty commissioners earn Sh180,160-Sh335,450, house allowance of Sh80,000 and a commuter allowance of Sh24,000 per month.\n\nThe addition of NGAPU—potentially adding Sh1–2 billion annually for 6,000 officers— pushes this burden higher, with no public breakdown to justify the expense. W\n\norse, security budgets, including NGAPU’s, remain shrouded in secrecy, a practice that mirrors the colonial government’s opaque funding of the Provincial Administration to suppress dissent rather than serve citizens.\n\nIf NGAO’s mandates— coordination, security and administrative services—have proven to overwhelm the Ministry of Interior, as their sprawling scope suggests, why not transfer these roles to existing constitutional offices? Security functions could shift to the National Police Service, administration to county governments and policy coordination retained by a leaner ministry.\n\nNGAPU’s launch only amplifies this question, adding a redundant police layer when NPS already struggles with a 1:450 officer-to-population ratio versus UN’s 1:280.\n\nYet, proponents of NGAO argue it’s indispensable. They point to chiefs’ grassroots reach—106,072 villages— claiming it fills gaps the NPS and counties cannot, as evidenced by the National Crime Research Centre’s (The Role of Chiefs in Localized Crime and Security Management, 2021) finding that 47.9 per cent of the members of public in Kenya said they would rate the performance of the chief as good.\n\nAnother, 25.8 per cent of the interviewed members of public would rate their chief performance as excellent.\n\nThe 2024 creation of 31 new administrative units, the NGAO proponents say, enhances service access in remote areas like Wajir, a feat counties lack the capacity to replicate.\n\nThis counterargument holds weight: NGAO’s proximity to citizens could, in theory, justify its existence where devolution falters.\n\nI hold that NGAO was born of operatives in the national government’s fear of losing control and most probably a transitional gift for the thousands of provincial administrators who were staring at joblessness post-2013 if they were not absorbed in the county government structures as had been proposed.\n\nNGAPU’s emergence, alongside NGAO’s conservatively estimated doubled costs (from Sh3 billion to Sh6 billion annually, plus NGAPU’s Sh1–2 billion) and the secrecy of security budgets, renews my alarm.\n\nI now hold a firm view that the executive is deploying NGAO and NGAPU the same way colonial rulers wielded the provincial administration—not as service tools but as instruments of control, echoing the 1929 Tribal Police under Chiefs to enforce British rule.','News','2025-04-05 07:02:23','2025-04-05 07:02:23',NULL),(50,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/2025-04-02-irene-nafula-how-connected-tech-ai-can-cut-healthcare-costs','IRENE NAFULA: How connected tech, AI can cut healthcare costs','2002-04-25 00:00:00','IRENE NAFULA','AI’s impact on Kenya’s economy stems from its potential to increase efficiency and innovation in businesses and households.\n\nA local tech expert and cyber operator says AI is a necessary evil whose time has come','News','2025-04-05 07:02:32','2025-04-05 07:02:32',NULL),(51,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/star-blogs/2025-04-02-diaspora-food-security-bond-will-unlock-kenyas-agriculture-potential','Diaspora food security bond will unlock Kenya’s agriculture potential','2002-04-25 00:00:00','ROBERT CHIURI','Kenya needs about $30 billion (Sh3.9 trillion) to create long term food security for its people that is not dependent primarily on seasonal rain regime or negative forces of Climate Change, a research by the Food Security Consortium – USA and Kenya has said.\n\nThe amount can be raised through government guaranteed Food Security Bond (FSB) or Diaspora-raised food security bonds.\n\nThere\'s a lot of goodwill in the Kenyan Diaspora community to participate in poverty alleviating projects in Kenya. The best way to defeat centuries-long poverty in Kenya is a concerted effort, all hands-on deck approach, by all Kenyans including the Government of Kenya, private enterprises and private investors and Kenyan Diaspora, among others.\n\nWe propose that the Government of Kenya forms a Food Security Authority to work with us in order to provide leadership on food, agriculture, value chains, natural resources, climate change, rural development, nutrition, and related issues based on public policy, the best available science and effective management to enhance food security.\n\nKenyans living abroad are keen to invest back home in irrigated agriculture. We are ready to contribute to financing, provide expertise, innovation, technology and other inputs in projects geared to solving perennial food insecurity in Kenya and thus enable economic freedoms for all Kenyans.\n\nBasic economic freedom we envisage with this initiative is a Kenya where every citizen has adequate food nutrition, clothing, affordable sanitary, shelter and enhanced food security. We are glad the Government of Kenya, through the State Department for Irrigation, has launched the National Irrigation Sector Investment Plan, an ambitious blueprint that aims to coordinate efforts around irrigation.The goal is to put an additional 1,000,000 acres of land under irrigation and optimise utilisation in the next ten years.\n\nWe followed keenly this launch from the Diaspora as the Cabinet Secretary for Water, Sanitation and Irrigation stated that a total cost of 598 billion shillings shall be required to actualise these targets with 61 per cent coming from the private sector and 39 per cent from public funding. The government went ahead to list various pathways or initiatives through which investors can venture into irrigation including corporate schemes, public schemes, community irrigation projects, farmer-led projects and Arid and Semi-Arid (ASAL) projects.\n\nWe believe that this is the right time for the government to consider our proposed Diaspora Food Security Bond as an additional pathway to achieving food security. Bonds are financial instruments that can be issued by governments and water companies to raise capital to fund water-related projects. The proceeds can be used to develop or improve water infrastructure like treatment plants, sewer management systems and distribution networks.\n\nThe opportunity will help water companies fulfil their development projects on a larger scale without heavy reliance on government and development partners funding. The President is committed to raising money from the capital markets and this initiative and the issuance of green finance and ESG frameworks are the future of the capital markets.\n\nNormally, Water Service Providers get funding from tariffs, taxes and transfers and repayable finances like loans, bonds and equity investments. Previously, the State attempted to attract private contributions through the Kenya Pooled Water Fund, which was incorporated in the Water ministry\'s 2018-22 strategic plan.The project aimed to raise Sh10 billion from local bond markets but did not achieve its goal. We can do it differently and make it work.\n\nDr Robert Chiuri is the President & CEO, Food Security Consortium-USA & Kenya - robert.chiuri@globalsusa.com','News','2025-04-05 07:02:41','2025-04-05 07:02:41',NULL),(52,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/leader/2025-04-03-editorial-we-mourn-the-death-of-promising-devolution','EDITORIAL: We mourn the death of promising devolution','2003-04-25 00:00:00','STAR EDITOR','The last conference was held in Eldoret, Uasin Gishu County in 2023.\n\nCounties are set to assume their full functions as outlined in the constitution','News','2025-04-05 07:02:50','2025-04-05 07:02:50',NULL),(53,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/2025-04-02-fredrick-okango-inclusivity-in-governance-is-a-path-to-national-unity','FREDRICK OKANGO: Inclusivity in governance is a path to national unity','2002-04-25 00:00:00','FREDRICK OKANGO','Farouk asked all Kenyans to follow the example of church leaders who consistently preach love and peace.\n\nCotu boss Francis Atwoli said implementation of the MoU will also usher in a period of political tranquility','News','2025-04-05 07:02:58','2025-04-05 07:02:58',NULL),(54,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/2025-04-03-emmanuel-wandera-invest-more-in-baseload-power-to-meet-demand','EMMANUEL WANDERA: Invest more in baseload power to meet demand','2003-04-25 00:00:00','EMMANUEL WANDERA','Senators and governors argue that the law is regressive and is not in the best interest of devolution.\n\nA report released by EPRA shows that 24.2% of the total energy purchased by the national utility was lost.','News','2025-04-05 07:03:08','2025-04-05 07:03:08',NULL),(55,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/2025-04-04-chrpk-jemima-ngode-harnessing-data-driven-hr-key-to-organizational-success','CHRPK JEMIMA NGODE: Harnessing data-driven HR key to organizational success','2004-04-25 00:00:00','CHRPK JEMIMA NGODE','In many organizations, HR departments serve as the backbone, facilitating essential functions that contribute to the organization’s success.\n\nWhen HR professionals experience harassment, the path to reporting can seem unclear and fraught.','News','2025-04-05 07:03:17','2025-04-05 07:03:17',NULL),(56,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/star-blogs/2025-04-02-kenyas-trade-future-amid-trumps-america-first-policies','K\'ONYANGO: Navigating uncertainty, Kenya\'s trade future amid Trump\'s \"America First\" policies','2002-04-25 00:00:00','ONYANGO K\'ONYANGO','Kenya must have a frank conversation about whether its foreign missions provide value for taxpayers\n\nIn Kenya, election years often bring tensions that create an unstable environment for growth and investment.','News','2025-04-05 07:03:26','2025-04-05 07:03:26',NULL),(57,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/columnists/2025-04-01-nicholas-okumu-force-that-could-reshape-healthcare-if-we-let-it','NICHOLAS OKUMU: Force that could reshape healthcare - if we let it','2001-04-25 00:00:00','NICHOLAS OKUMU','Mobility poverty remains a critical barrier to effective healthcare delivery\n\nHealthcare is a necessity, yet access to quality medical attention remains a privilege for many.\n\nAcross Kenya, hospitals are forced to provide services on credit, waiting months or even years for reimbursement.\n\nAI technologies are already helping doctors spot fractures and detect early signs of disease.','News','2025-04-05 07:03:44','2025-04-05 07:03:44',NULL),(58,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/opinion/star-blogs/2025-04-03-david-osiany-there-are-men-then-there-was-george','DAVID OSIANY: There are men, then there was George','2003-04-25 00:00:00','DAVID OSIANY','You see, there are people who are just built differently.

It takes a very rare personality to be able to stand by your boss and friend for almost 35 years: unyielding, unbowed, and unfettered.\n\nGeorge has been the true depiction of “Till death do us part”. He has spent his years putting his life on the line for the political idol of our generation, Rt. Hon. Raila Odinga. I don’t want to imagine the number of times he has stared at death coming so close to him or his boss.\n\nI say this because a keen look at Jakom’s political journey, full of risk-taking and being a daring leader, will show a man who never missed by his side. GEORGE WAS THERE.\n\nHe has been there to see Jakom tear-gassed in maandamanos… There to witness as Jakom lost his cool sometimes… There to watch friends who turned to be traitors… There to experience Baba in his lowest moments when he probably wailed in agonizing pain… There to shield Raila from attacks on the political battle fronts.\n\nWhat has this man not witnessed? What has he not seen? Yet this man, a whole library, one who would have shared about encounters with the enigma up close, now lies in death.\n\nWho knows how many times George may have been offered crazy cash to compromise Jakom’s security but turned it down for loyalty’s sake? Who can tell us the way Jakom reacts to his stolen elections by experiencing up close? Will we ever know?\n\nDeath has this harrowing arrogance that is dumbfounding. It chides humans hurtfully to a point it almost seems to be saying, “I can take the strong when I please, and harvest the meek when I choose”. It has grimly reaped a great man once more. George has rested.\n\nI have been privileged to know this good man for close to 16 years, since my first encounter with Baba. He was always kind. He never got absorbed in the pushing and shoving around Raila. He kept a level head always: when Baba was in government and even when Baba was government.\n\nHe attracted deep respect because of his candor and kindness. Now he rests in the sleep of death. What a man! What a tragic loss for Jakom. What a loss for us who loved him and built a bond with him around Jakom.\n\nGeorge was no longer a mere aide but family.

The film explores the gap between parents and their children not talking about issues of sexuality, their bodies and health.\n\nJack Mutinda, who plays the role of a father to TY in the film, said, “There’s no better place for kids to learn about some issues than at home. This will make it even easier for them to open up on sexuality issues that they face because the door has been opened for that discussion.”\n\nTalking about sex in the past was a taboo, but Mutinda appreciates the role his mother played in his life. “Unfortunately I never had a dad growing up, but my mum was proactive in [talking about sex],” he said. “This really helped me in knowing how to talk about this with my son and not waiting for him to figure it out by himself.”\n\nWhile ‘Know Thy Body, Know Thy Self’ focuses on the silence around sexuality and body awareness, ‘Bella Is Dying, Maybe Next Week’ shifts the lens to another critical issue: misinformation and the courage to have honest conversations. Bella is directed by Abigail Arunga and Mkaiwawi Mwakaba and produced by James Kombo.\n\nAdelle Onyango, a media personality, poet and women’s rights activist, wrote and directed her film, ‘Home’, with Roy Ncheeri as the producer. The short film captures the life of a young Kenyan girl (Adhis) and her relationship with her body.\n\nIn an interview with the Star, Adelle said that a part of the film was shot in a school she attended when she was 15 years old, and the character borrows a lot from her personal experiences but also expands to accommodate many African girls’ and women’s experiences.\n\n“We often experience a grave sense of not belonging because we don’t live up to society’s definition of beauty, a definition that is forever changing,” Adelle said.\n\n“Many of us experience family members, teachers, colleagues and so on, who tell us things that make us question our worthiness. So I think many of us can identify with Adhis.”\n\nFor Adelle, directing her first film was a deeply personal experience, one that transformed her poetry into a cinematic language accessible to a wider audience. “What’s incredible is finally sharing poetry in a language that many people can understand, which is film,” she says.\n\nShe wants the adult audiences who watch her film to introspect on their interactions with younger generations and see if they are carrying forward hurt and trauma.\n\n“I want African women to watch ‘Home’ and shed the shame and expectations society sets for us. And immediately start the journey back home to themselves.\n\n“For African girls, I want them to see themselves in Adhis and realise that they are so worthy as they are.”\n\n‘Float’ is the fourth film that will premiere on the same day. Produced by Ivy Kiru and directed by Lydia Matata, it tells the story of a 14-year-old girl, Wendo, a swimming champion struggling with her own skin.\n\nThrough the collaboration of International Resource for Impact and Storytelling and Docubox, each filmmaker was given creative freedom to develop a story that reflects personal and societal realities, shaping narratives that feel authentic and relevant.\n\nAdelle believes Kenya’s film industry is brimming with talent, and with the right support, it can reach its full potential.','News','2025-04-05 07:04:23','2025-04-05 07:04:23',NULL),(61,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/sasa/entertainment/2025-02-23-jiji-ndogo-death-of-valentine-the-hanged-body','JIJI NDOGO: Death of Valentine: The \'hanged\' body','2023-02-25 00:00:00','DAVID MUCHAI','Villager is not too pleased by the innovation as landlord remains hungry\n\nChildren can get up to the dumbest mischief sometimes','News','2025-04-05 07:04:34','2025-04-05 07:04:34',NULL),(62,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/sasa/entertainment/2025-02-25-photos-bensoul-chris-kaiga-bring-the-vibe-to-magical-kenyan-open-village','[PHOTOS] Bensoul, Chris Kaiga bring the vibe to Magical Kenyan Open Village','2025-02-25 00:00:00','DENNIS MILIMO','While new golf balls can be quite costly, used options provide similar performance at a fraction of the price.\n\nThe path to professionalism remains elusive for many','News','2025-04-05 07:04:50','2025-04-05 07:04:50',NULL),(63,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/sasa/entertainment/2025-03-28-afrobeats-singer-lojay-drops-new-single-somebody-like-you','Afrobeats Singer Lojay Drops New Single \'Somebody Like You\'','2028-03-25 00:00:00','PENINAH NJOKI','‘Somebody Like You’ tells a story of hope.

Bonuses attract players by offering potential more cash while simultaneously benefiting operators by enhancing player acquisition, engagement, and retention.\n\nThese bonuses correspond to your deposit amount by a set percentage to augment your casino cash. Match deposit incentives typically vary from 100% to 400% of the first investment and are undoubtedly the most popular casino bonuses of all.\n\nShould the casino offer a 100% bonus, it will match your deposit, doubling your playing budget. The 400% bonuses provide you with four times your initial amount in addition to your original investment, and you can find a plethora of these bonuses at trusty sites like BonusFinder.com.\n\nThis provides tangible benefits to seasoned gamers already familiar with gambling and prepared to deposit while also allowing newcomers to play with some extra money.\n\nFree spin promos provide additional rounds on renowned slot titles. Casinos use them to advertise a new slot game, a certain title, or a particular slot supplier.\n\nThese bonuses serve as a genuine incentive for those wishing to explore new Slots without any deposit or with a small amount. They benefit gamers who like brief gaming sessions since their duration is often limited.\n\nThey are particularly advantageous for novice gamers, as they can assess their preference for a casino site before making a payment.\n\nCashback bonuses provide monies based on your gameplay performance. If you\'re not familiar with this type of bonus, it\'s essentially a refund on your losses. For example, a 10% cashback bonus on a $ 100 loss would give you $ 10 back. Furthermore, certain cashback incentives provide a proportion of your losses, whilst others allocate a fraction of the wagers made at a certain casino within a designated period.\n\nThey significantly benefit frequent casino players by enabling continued engagement with favored games.\n\nAlthough casino bonuses provide clear advantages for all players, certain awards may only benefit a certain kind of player.\n\nPlayers are attracted to online casino bonuses mostly due to the opportunity to get more playing money. Opting for game-specific incentives, such as those for slots or making a little deposit in advance, provides an advantageous supplement that enhances your wagering capacity. Thus, augmenting your gaming budget is a genuine benefit for novices, big rollers, or infrequent players adhering to a constrained budget.\n\nThe probability hypothesis posits that prolonged engagement in a casino game may increase the likelihood of achieving a profit. However, this is effective just for brief gaming sessions.\n\nRegardless of your inclination towards low-stakes chance games or high-stakes live dealer games, this is a legitimate incentive.\n\nGames of chance, such as Slots and Roulette, are unlikely to provide winning combinations in the first minutes. A prolonged session offers more chances to achieve a winning streak since each spin or wager is independent of its predecessor. Engaging in live dealer games, for example, such as Blackjack and Baccarat, necessitates extended play sessions since this allows for skill development and opponent analysis.\n\nPlayers can customize their bonuses to align with your gameplay preferences. As a result, this diverse array of bonuses allows you to choose prizes according to your playing style.\n\nLet us delineate the words that often provide significant challenges and elucidate strategies for mitigating the associated dangers to optimize your online gaming experience.\n\nSelecting casino bonuses with elevated wagering requirements jeopardizes your ability to withdraw earnings. This is a common error since many casino offers with high wagering requirements sometimes provide substantial bonus money or a significant quantity of spins.\n\nWagering requirements indicate the amount you must bet on your bonus cash before withdrawing any earnings. With high wagering limits, you may need to stake and forfeit your profits. Note: prolonged sessions are effective only in the short term.\n\nThis danger may be mitigated by evaluating various bonuses and selecting those without wagering requirements. Alternatively, choose bonuses with substantial value and wagering requirements of 40 times the bonus amount or less.\n\nUnjustifiable expiry dates significantly threaten the retention of your winnings and bonus monies. These time-limited bonuses require completion of the playing within the specified duration, as failure to comply results in forfeiting any leftover bonus cash and any earnings gained from using the promotional funds.\n\nGame limits jeopardize your total playing happiness since several casino incentives are applicable only to certain titles. For example, a bonus might only be usable on a specific slot game or a particular type of table game, limiting your options and potentially reducing your enjoyment.\n\nUtilizing your bonus on games other than those specified in the Terms and Conditions may extend your wagering requirements or fail to contribute towards meeting the playthrough obligation. This may influence your probability of winning or withdrawing your money.\n\nMitigating this danger involves selecting promotions relevant to your preferred games or those with little to no limitations.\n\nPromotions often include dangerous circumstances since online casino companies must also ensure profitability. Always remember that a reward justifies the risk when the potential gain exceeds the possible loss.\n\nIn summary, while online casino bonuses provide advantages like more dollars and complimentary spins, they are accompanied by substantial stipulations, including elevated wagering requirements and stringent time constraints. The value of these incentives is contingent upon your gaming habits and your willingness to fulfill the casino\'s stipulated conditions.','News','2025-04-05 07:05:20','2025-04-05 07:05:20',NULL),(66,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/sasa/entertainment/2025-03-23-jiji-ndogo-death-of-valentine-the-foreign-connection','JIJI NDOGO: Death of Valentine: The foreign connection','2023-03-25 00:00:00','DAVID MUCHAI','There is the issue with the typed suicide note, which could’ve been written by anyone. The victim looked prepared for the next few days, unlike someone who’s ready to take his life. The woman he’s supposed to have killed himself over disputes any kind of deep connection, and there’s also the matter of a missing laptop.\n\nThe fact that I, Sgt Makini of Jiji Ndogo Police Post and a simpleton at best, brought these issues to the fore has a few people on edge. My partner and common-law wife Sergeant Sophia is beginning to think I’ve been a hypocrite all along. A savant masquerading as a dimwit. That sentence on its own would only work to affirm her case.\n\n“Maybe you were you a detective in another life,” Sophia says. “That’s the only way to explain this.”\n\nShe scoffs and toys with the collar of her uniform shirt. “That’s not what I’m saying. It’s just that… I feel like it’s a dream and I’ll soon wake up and all this won’t be real, you know? I mean, it’s…” She stops and looks me straight in the eyes. “I’m not used to you being like this. It’s like… like a paradigm shift.”\n\n“It means a fundamental change in approach or underlying assumptions,” a voice says from behind me. I turn around to see Detective Gundua standing by the door. “Hi, Sophia,” he says. “What philosophical topic are you kids on now, huh?”\n\n“Good afternoon, detective,” I say, already feeling as if I’m intruding on a private conversation. “Any new developments on the case?”\n\n“As a matter of fact, there is.” He consults his notes. “I’m going to go out on a limb here and say you got very lucky on this one.”\n\n“You know how they say penicillin was discovered after a scientist left out a sandwich on a table in a lab?”\n\n“All I’m saying is,” Gundua goes on, “Makini boy here hit a once-in-a-lifetime jackpot. The autopsy report is out. Valentine was strangled but not by the rope he was hanging from. That was only staged to look like a suicide. He was killed because of his social media activity.”\n\n“He only pretended to be gay for likes,” Gundua corrects. “But most of the ‘gifts’ he was receiving were only a way for Nigerian drug dealers to launder money.”\n\n“It happens more than you’d think. These ‘influencers’ get a crapload of money, keep some and send the rest back to the ‘gifters’ as clean money.”\n\nGundua smiles condescendingly. “Sgt Makini, you were lucky, but leave the rest to the real detectives, okay? Stick to your lane.”','News','2025-04-05 07:05:30','2025-04-05 07:05:30',NULL),(67,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/sasa/entertainment/2025-02-14-bachelors-diary-valentines-what-a-scam','BACHELOR\'S DIARY: Valentine’s?

She advocated safe sex and encouraged young girls and women to carry female condoms with them, a precaution she believed would make them less vulnerable to unwanted pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections.\n\nPhelgone was undeterred by her circumstances. Living in the slums and a victim of gender-based violence herself, she went to great lengths to change the lives of the women she took under her wing in the Pal Omega support group for persons living with HIV-Aids.\n\nThe community event was attended by Kisumu First Lady Dorothy Nyong’o, who delivered a heartfelt keynote address. Mrs Nyong’o, visibly moved by the film, spoke about the importance of sharing Mama Phelgone’s story and the honour of hosting the Kisumu premiere in Manyatta, the very place where Phelgone’s work had made an incredible impact.\n\n“I wish I could have met Mama Phelgone in person,” she tearfully remarked after watching the film for the first time with the rest of the audience. She said she hopes we can all learn from the example Mama Phelgone set. She also recognised Phelgone’s son, Michael, urging him to continue his mother’s vital work.The screening attracted a diverse group of stakeholders, including representatives from Kenya Red Cross, KMET, Nephak, the Africa Cancer Foundation, the Safe Water and Aids Project and The Rahil Kotak, as well as residents. The event created a special moment for the community to reflect on the extraordinary work of Mama Phelgone, a mother figure to all, who devoted her life to supporting those living with HIV and SGBV in Manyatta.\n\nAt the end of the event, Mrs Nyong’o presented Pal Omega with a special gift: a Dholuo copy of ‘Sulwe’, a book writen by her daughter Lupita Nyong’o, which highlights the important issue of colourism among young Black girls.\n\nThe event also featured a panel discussion with the film\'s award-winning director and producer, Kiana Rawji, who shared her personal connection to the story. Rawji, a Canadian filmmaker who created the documentary in 2022 while studying film and history at Harvard University, explained how she first met Phelgone through her elder sister Zahra several years ago.\n\n“I was struck by Mama Phelgone’s strength and grace, and I knew I had to document her story,” Rawji said. Her goal was to tell a story of empowerment, joy and resilience without sugarcoating harsh realities, rather than the stereotypical narratives often associated with African communities.\n\nRawji’s ‘Mama of Manyatta’ has already screened at prestigious festivals worldwide, including the 2023 Zanzibar International Film Festival, where it received a Special Jury Mention, as well as the Pan-African Film Festival in Los Angeles, and the Essence Film Festival in New Orleans.\n\nIn the past couple of years, it has also screened at the Nanji Family Foundation Auditorium at the Aga Khan Museum in Toronto and the Cardel Theatre in Calgary. The Kisumu screening was particularly special as it marked the film’s premiere in the very community where it was filmed. Rawji remarked that this was the most important screening of all.\n\nThe event was a testament to the power of storytelling and the lasting impact of Mama Phelgone’s work and legacy, which Pal Omega carries on today. The audience left with heaviness and grief for Phelgone’s passing, but also a shared sense of inspiration, reflection and commitment to continue the work that she started.','News','2025-04-05 07:06:12','2025-04-05 07:06:12',NULL),(71,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/sasa/entertainment/2025-04-02-perpetual-bachelor-the-sexual-harassment-workshop','PERPETUAL BACHELOR: The sexual harassment workshop','2002-04-25 00:00:00','DAVID MUCHAI','I went on a date with an Icelandic beauty called Helga, who turned out to be my new boss at work. Worse, she refused to terminate the relationship and has turned my work life into a hellish prison. Apparently, women from Iceland are among the most forward you’ll ever meet.\n\nYearning to end things, I gave her a piece of my mind via email, only to press ‘Send to All’. Now the HR department is on my case, saying the email amounted to sexual harassment. I got a castigating letter and was ordered to attend a sexual harassment workshop. My pleas to Helga to make it disappear have fallen on deaf ears. It seems I might have succeeded in cutting her off my daily life, but at the cost of this most unwelcome seminar.\n\nAt the conference hall are three other people — two men and a woman. The co-culprit next to me is a short, balding man and with a mousy face.\n\n“Nah.” He shakes his head and sits back, his arms across his chest. “Public works company over in Ngong. Wanna know what I did? Same thing I always do. Asked Margo to have dinner with me.”\n\nHe lowers his voice to a conspiratorial whisper. “Frankly, I truly don’t care about a date with Margo, you know?”\n\n“She’s my secretary,” he continues with nary a pause. “Margo is, you see. Married with kids and all that. Not even close to my type. But I say something like this, she goes running to HR and I end up here.”\n\n“I don’t get it. Is it good or bad? You make it sound bad, yet you also stated you harass your secretary on purpose so you can be…”\n\nMy words trail off as the leader of the workshop enters the room. She’s tall and elegant. So gorgeous that the thoughts that run through my mind would make a Catholic father quit.\n\nMy neighbour elbows me in the ribs. “See? What did I tell you? She’s worth spending hours in this dump, isn’t she?”\n\nI turn to him. “You, my man, are sick and disgusting. The thought that you mistreat one woman to come ogle another one is utterly nauseating.”\n\nI rise to my feet and extend my hand to the lady. “Good morning. Name’s Tom, and I don’t believe I belong here.”\n\n“Nice try, Tom,” she says matter-of-factly. “Take your seat and listen carefully. Everyone here thinks he shouldn’t be. And, oh, they’ve all tried hitting on me, which is more sexual harassment, no?”','News','2025-04-05 07:06:29','2025-04-05 07:06:29',NULL),(72,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/sasa/entertainment/2025-01-16-mboya-revived-in-long-but-fun-play','Mboya revived in long but fun play','2016-01-25 00:00:00','SELINA CHAHANGO','As the name suggests, the play chronicles the life and legacy of Tom Mboya, delving into his early years, the beginnings of his career as a trade unionist, his rise to prominence as a political and national leader, and ultimately, his tragic assassination. The production also explores personal facets of his life, offering audiences a glimpse into the man behind the icon.\n\nGiven the breadth of Mboya’s achievements and his towering historical significance, attempting to capture his entire life story in a single production is nothing short of ambitious. Yet the series rises to the challenge, weaving together a compelling narrative that pays tribute to one of Kenya’s most influential figures.\n\nIn the November 2024 series, the production’s structure was primarily narrative, with different narrators recounting various aspects of Mboya’s life, interspersed with skits that brought key moments to life.\n\nThe Too Early for Birds cast delivered a stellar performance, with each narrator infusing their unique style and energy into the storytelling. The chemistry among the cast members was palpable, adding an organic vibrancy to the stage interactions. Even when lines were forgotten, their improvisation felt natural, creating spontaneous moments of humour that only enhanced the experience. The seamless yet hilariously engaging transitions and reentries further underscored the production’s creative brilliance, drawing the audience deeper into the narrative.\n\nThe skits and dance numbers were far more captivating than the narrations. Take, for instance, the Unbwogable scene, which powerfully depicted Mboya’s first encounter with workplace racism, or the Mombasa scene, where his charisma and influence as a trade unionist came vividly to life.\n\nIn the Jaba scene, the crew skillfully wove in the various theories — both factual and conspiratorial — about Mboya’s motives and political manoeuvres, adding depth and intrigue to the story. One standout moment was Mama Africa, a skit that hilariously yet aptly portrayed Mboya’s reputation as an eternal playboy. I still catch myself laughing at the memory of it.\n\nAdditionally, I appreciated the non-linear storytelling. The constant shifts between past and future kept the narrative fluid and engaging, drawing connections and ensuring the audience stayed on their toes.\n\nHowever, as the central figure of the story, I found Mboya’s presence on stage surprisingly understated. He appeared only in brief intervals, feeling more like a background character than the main focus. This limited presence made it difficult to form a deep emotional connection with him. That said, the actor portraying Mboya was perfectly cast, with a striking resemblance to the historical figure and an ability to embody Mboya’s commanding aura convincingly.\n\nNyokabi Maina, on the other hand, was an absolute tour de force. A true chameleon, she transformed effortlessly into a variety of characters, each one distinct and compelling. As a narrator, she was stern yet hilariously engaging. As Mombasa Woman #2, she was utterly convincing. As Police Officer #2, her comedic timing was impeccable, and as Jaba Woman, she was entirely in character. Sema range!\n\nElsaphan Njora was another standout. A delight to watch, he brought incredible depth to his roles, fully inhabiting each character with a nuanced understanding of their essence. His performance was so convincing that, for a moment, I almost believed he was the one who killed Mboya! And his signature tagline — Baallllls! — was a showstopper every time.\n\nThen there was Anubhav, whose energy infused the entire production with vitality. His leaps, strides and twists across the stage were mesmerising, drawing the audience’s attention and keeping us invigorated. It was impossible not to follow his enthusiastic movements, which added an electrifying dimension to the performance.\n\nThe costumes were a highlight for me, transporting me straight into the 1960s with their impeccable attention to detail. The flared pants, low-heeled shoes paired with socks, oversized suits, neatly parted hair and pastel tones created a vivid snapshot of the era. Every look added authenticity and charm, grounding the performance firmly in Mboya’s time.\n\nWhile I appreciated the immense effort it must have taken to construct the towering stage prop, I felt the set design had untapped potential. It could have been more dynamic and engaging. For instance, the dome could have featured changing visuals, reflecting different periods of Mboya’s life, adding depth and narrative continuity.\n\nAlternatively, the team might have utilised a broader range of props to create a more immersive and visually captivating experience. These enhancements could have elevated the production’s storytelling even further.\n\nOverall, Too Early for Birds lived up to the hype. With its talented cast, sharp humour and the emotional gravity of the script, it’s easy to see why the show consistently sells out.\n\nNevertheless, tackling the entire life of a towering figure like Tom Mboya is an ambitious undertaking, perhaps too ambitious. Four hours is a significant stretch to keep the audience engaged, especially given the heavy reliance on narration.\n\nBy the end of the performance, it was clear that the audience was drained. Some members didn’t make it through the entire show, and moments like the Waruhiu connection were lost in the sea of information, overwhelmed by the sheer density of the material.\n\nA stronger balance of “showing” over “telling” would have made the experience more immersive. More skits accompanying the narration could have added much-needed variety and visual engagement. Alternatively, focusing on a particular aspect of his life — such as his career as a trade unionist or the political intrigue surrounding his assassination — might have been more fitting. The second half of the show demonstrated this potential, showcasing how powerful a more focused narrative could be.\n\nThat being said, I absolutely loved the ending scene. It was a powerful moment that really tugged at our heartstrings, paying a fitting tribute to the fallen Maandamano heroes. A poignant reminder of the sacrifices made for the freedoms we sometimes take for granted.\n\nThe work Too Early For Birds is doing is incredibly impactful, not just for its cultural and sociopolitical relevance but also for the way it educates audiences about aspects of history that are often overlooked or obscured. These hidden narratives bring a new depth to our understanding of the past.','News','2025-04-05 07:06:49','2025-04-05 07:06:49',NULL),(73,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/sasa/entertainment/2025-03-30-jiji-ndogo-the-road-to-success-is-lonely','JIJI NDOGO: The road to success is lonely','2030-03-25 00:00:00','DAVID MUCHAI','Deceased was known online as gay man\n\nPoor fellow messed with Nigerian drug dealers','News','2025-04-05 07:06:58','2025-04-05 07:06:58',NULL),(74,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/sasa/entertainment/2025-03-18-jiji-ndogo-death-of-valentine-the-double-life-clue','JIJI NDOGO: Death of Valentine: The double life clue','2018-03-25 00:00:00','DAVID MUCHAI','Sophia is convinced it was suicide but Makini is baffled by the particulars\n\nIt looked like business as usual in his life until the alleged suicide','News','2025-04-05 07:07:09','2025-04-05 07:07:09',NULL),(75,'https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2025-04-05-ruto-to-visit-kiambu-nyeri-as-he-concludes-week-long-mt-kenya-tour','President Ruto to visit Kiambu and Nyeri as he concludes week-long Mt Kenya tour','2005-04-25 00:00:00','JAMES MBAKA','\"Tumeongea mambo ya chama hapa?

Subscribe and read news in favourite messenger.\n\nThe United States has been notably quiet about the issue, having not commented since President Donald Trump returned to the White House.\n\nThe Pacific and Caribbean island states are leading the group pushing for a carbon tax, with support from other countries including the UK.\n\nThey argue that funds raised from a levy could be redistributed to nations most vulnerable to climate change to help adapt and mitigate its effects.\n\n\"Climate change is a terrifying lived reality for my country,\" said Albon Ishoda, the Marshall Islands\' representative to the IMO.\n\nHowever, around 15 countries strongly oppose the carbon levy, arguing it would exacerbate inequalities between nations and raise the costs of goods such as palm oil, cereals and corn.\n\nConcerns are also mounting that the European Union, once a supporter of a carbon tax, could water down the measure in favour of a carbon credit system.\n\nRead also\n\nTrump tariffs to test resiliency of US consumers\n\nSuch a system would allow companies or countries to buy and sell credits representing the right to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide.\n\nAccording to University College London research, the option of no levy presents the biggest risk to meeting the shipping sector\'s climate goals.\n\nIt could also distort fuel prices and create an uneven playing field, favouring states with strong industrial polices, such as China, researchers said.\n\n\"The fastest and cheapest energy transition is brought about by a strong levy,\" combined with a global fuel standard to reduce the carbon intensity of fuels used by ships, they added.\n\nChallenges also remain with the fuel standard system, particularly the risk of using alternative fuels such as palm oil and soybean oil, which indirectly contribute to emissions through deforestation, Pointet explained.\n\nWhile Brazil defends the key role of these biofuels, more than 60 environmental protection NGOs have raised objections to their inclusion in the future shipping fuel mix.\n\nOther potential solutions include synthetic hydrogen-based fuels, currently very expensive to produce, or the installation of wind-powered propulsion systems onboard ship.\n\nSource: AFP\n\nAFP AFP text, photo, graphic, audio or video material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium.

While genetic makeup primarily affects an individual\'s hair type, other factors like environmental conditions play a part. So, what do you need to know about type 1A hair?\n\nWhat is the rarest hair type in the world? According to research and hair experts, type 1A hair is the rarest of all hair types across the global population. This unique hair type has no curls and requires special care. 1A hair is common among women of Asian descent. Here are some quick facts about this hair:\n\nRead also\n\n15 black celebrities with curly hair who look great in 2021\n\nType 1A is the straightest among the three type 1 hair types. It is pin-straight, flat, and fine, with a feathery appearance. Type 1B is straight with minimal volume and body, while 1C is straight but thick, with considerable volume.\n\n1A hair strands are straight and do not curl even when wet, making it difficult to hold the hair in styles that require volume. The light strands make it prone to breakage. Women with type 1A hair are advised to get short, blunt haircuts to increase the hair volume and the appearance of thickness.\n\nOne of the most notable traits of type 1A hair is its oiliness caused by the natural hair oil freely moving up and down the straight follicles. For this reason, this hair type requires frequent shampooing using dry shampoos to control the oiliness.\n\nRead also\n\nList of black hair types and how to identify them (pictures)\n\nType 1A hair has a smooth sheen that gives it a striking appearance due to the production of natural hair oils. The oils keep the hair moisturized and resilient to other forms of damage. Compared to other hair types, 1A grows relatively fast.\n\nType 1A hair can be flat and plain, restricting individuals from exploring different hairstyles. Additionally, the natural production of sebum can make it greasy. Here are some tips on how to manage this hair type:\n\nRead also\n\nWhat is the difference between 3c and 4a hair?\n\nAccording to Vogue, an estimated 60% of the global population has naturally curly hair. The prevalence varies across ethnicity and background. Curly hair is found primarily among African natives although it is also found in the European, Middle Eastern, South Asian, and Latin American regions.\n\nNo. Type 2A hair is common among people of Caucasian descent and a few of mixed heritage. It is flat for a few inches from the root, gaining volume and body towards the end of the strands. The naturally loose waves have an \'S\' shape. Type 2A hair has a fine to medium texture that is easy to manage and style. The curls can be straightened using heat styling or enhanced using holding products.\n\nRead also\n\n15 must-have African hair accessories for black women\n\nWhat is the rarest hair type?

During that period, she voiced some shows and was hired as a ring announcer, initially working at 205 Live and NXT before taking over Smackdown.

In addition, Samantha performed the American national anthem at various sports events, but it is not known if she is paid for these live performances.\n\nFurthermore, she appeared in shows such as Got 2B Trill: The Untold Story (2015), Got 2B Real (2012) and Social Girl (2018).\n\nBeyond these roles, Samantha has a huge social media following, with over 1 million Instagram followers and over 300,000 X fans, which allows her to boost her income through brand collaborations.\n\nRead also\n\nAshley Graham\'s weight loss: Here everything you need to know\n\nCompared to former WWE female announcers, Samantha is well-paid.

Join Tuko.co.ke Sports News channel on WhatsApp now!\n\nTikTok on Friday was hours from a deadline to find a non-Chinese owner or face a ban in the United States.\n\nThe hugely popular video-sharing app, which has more than 170 million American users, is under threat from a US law that passed overwhelmingly last year and orders TikTok to split from its Chinese owner ByteDance or get shut down in the United States.\n\nUS President Donald Trump on Thursday said his administration was \"very close\" to a deal to find a buyer for TikTok, adding that it involved \"multiple\" investors but giving no further details.\n\nMotivated by national security fears and widespread belief in Washington that TikTok is ultimately controlled by the Chinese government, the law took effect on January 19, one day before Trump\'s inauguration.\n\nIn the hours before that deadline, TikTok temporarily shut down in the United States and disappeared from app stores, to the dismay of millions of users.\n\nRead also\n\nTrump goads China after Beijing retaliates in global trade war\n\nBut the Republican president quickly announced a 75-day delay and TikTok subsequently restored service to existing users, returning to the Apple and Google app stores in February.\n\nPAY ATTENTION: TUKO is in WhatsApp Channels now! Subscribe and read news in favourite messenger.\n\nThat delay is set to expire at midnight (0400 GMT) on April 5, but Trump has repeatedly downplayed risks that TikTok is in danger, saying he remains confident of finding a buyer for the app\'s US business.\n\nThe president also suggested TikTok could even be part of a broader deal with China to ease the stinging tariffs he imposed on Beijing as part of a worldwide blitz of levies.\n\nAsked Thursday if he was willing to make deals with countries on tariffs, he said: \"As long as they are giving us something that is good. For instance with TikTok.\"\n\n\"We have a situation with TikTok where China will probably say we\'ll approve a deal, but will you do something on the tariffs. The tariffs give us great power to negotiate,\" he added.\n\nRead also\n\nTikTok must find non-Chinese owner by Saturday to avert US ban\n\nAccording to reports, the most likely solution would see existing US investors in ByteDance roll over their stakes into a new independent global TikTok company.\n\nAdditional US investors, including Oracle and Blackstone, the private equity firm, would be brought on to reduce ByteDance\'s share.\n\nMuch of TikTok\'s US activity is already housed on Oracle servers, and the company\'s chairman, Larry Ellison, is a longtime Trump ally.\n\nBut uncertainty remains, particularly over what would happen to TikTok\'s valuable algorithm.\n\n\"TikTok without its algorithm is like Harry Potter without his wand — it\'s simply not as powerful,\" said Forrester Principal Analyst Kelsey Chickering.\n\n\"If the TikTok experience degrades, users, creators, and advertisers will spend more time and money on other media channels,\" she added.\n\nThe New York Times suggested the new company could license it from ByteDance.\n\nSuch an arrangement would go against the spirit of the law, which is in part based on the premise that TikTok\'s algorithm can be weaponized by the Chinese against US interests.\n\nRead also\n\nAsian stocks extend global rout after Trump\'s shock tariff blitz\n\nAmazon has also reportedly made a last-minute bid to buy TikTok.\n\nOther proposals include an initiative called \"The People\'s Bid for TikTok,\" launched by real estate and sports tycoon Frank McCourt\'s Project Liberty initiative.\n\nArtificial intelligence startup Perplexity recently expressed interest in buying TikTok, as did a joint venture involving YouTube mega-celebrity MrBeast and another bid from adult content platform OnlyFans.\n\nTrump, though he supported a ban in his first term, has lately become a TikTok defender, seeing it as a reason more young voters supported him in November\'s election.\n\nOne of his major political donors, billionaire Jeff Yass, is a major stakeholder in parent company ByteDance.\n\nSource: AFP\n\nAFP AFP text, photo, graphic, audio or video material shall not be published, broadcast, rewritten for broadcast or publication or redistributed directly or indirectly in any medium.

I remember we used to watch Music Time, I think Fred Machoka used to host the show so there was music from Nigeria, South Africa, Congo, Cameron and Senega. As we grew a lot of music was from the West, soul music, rap and R&B. So a lot of music at that time was vernacular music. My dad used to listen to country music, he would play artistes like Kenny Rogers, Dolly Parton, at times Bob Marley, so you can see the bled. But there was a gap, so by the time I was clearing school there was a need for a sound we could relate to. That is how when we joined studios like Calif Records, Ogopa Dejays, Samawati etc. By the time I was joining Ogopa, we had started getting vibes from different producers and people like akina Kalamashaka, Bambo, Abass Kubaff and then akina Wyre, Nazizi joined in and they were very young artistes. We started identifying with them because they were young and had different vibe. That is how we started to emulate those that came before us and the blend of music we had listened to, we to now blend it all and created our own sound.
